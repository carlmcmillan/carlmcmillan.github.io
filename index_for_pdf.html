		<h2>Objective</h2>
 		<!--hr-->
		<p>My background is mostly as a software developer and devops engineer, I am currently studying AI as I believe it can provide very useful tools to help us with everyday tasks, I am driven by solving problems in simple and efficient ways.</p>
		<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
		<!--hr-->
		<p>Java, Python, Groovy, SQL, Javascript, Chef/Ruby, HCL</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Used Java for creating bigger applications and microservices, mostly for integration, main reason I like it is extensive support and libraries</li>
			<li>Use Python for machine learning and where scripts are needed but also like it as an application language as it is simple and also has good libraries</li>
			<li>Have used SQL and Javascript a lot back when i was making web apps, but not as much now as have been doing mainly integration</li>
			<li>Used Chef/Ruby for building VM's and installing applications where Docker wasn't an option, but use Docker/Kubernetes where I can</li>
			<li>Use HCL (Hashicorp configuration language) for building environments in AWS</li>
			<li>Often used languages like Groovy for working with different tools like Jenkins</li>
		</ul>
